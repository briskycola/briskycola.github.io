## Introduction
I'm often asked how I got into using Linux and the
command line. I've known about Linux for a very long
time, but only started using it actively for about
four years. As I reflect on my experiences, it has
been one of the most interesting, frustrating, and
rewarding experiences I've had.

## First Start
I first discovered Linux in 2020 after becoming
frustrated with the direction Microsoft was going
with Windows. With the telemetry in Windows becoming
worse and worse, I was starting to question Microsoft's
plans with the OS and ultimately came to the conclusion
that the old days of Windows were over, and it was time
to move on. I would sometimes try Linux on my main PC,
but would ultimately go back to Windows due to issues
with Linux. For example, I would have issues with the
Nvidia drivers (they are much better now). Looking back,
those issues may have been my fault, but I didn't
know at the time.

As a result of my failures using Linux, I began to
dislike it. I thought it was a terrible OS and it would
never become mainstream. However, the more I thought
about it, the more ridiculous it seemed. If Linux
was so bad, how could it still be around today, and
how could there be so many zealots claiming it was
the greatest thing to have ever been conceived by
mankind?

## Learning Linux (The Right Way)
In 2022, my high school's IT department were
getting rid of old laptops, and I was able to get one for
free. It was a ThinkPad R61 from 2008. Not knowing what to
do with the computer, I remembered that I could install
Linux on this thing. Windows 10 would have been slow
and I could learn Linux while keeping my current PC
intact.

From there, I tried all of the easy to use distributions
such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Fedora. Eventually,
I started to use more advanced distros such as
Arch, Artix, and Void. Since I was using a much older
computer, I started experimenting with tiling window
managers to get a lighter graphical environment.
After testing all of these distros, I realized that
I liked Arch based distros the best, due to the
release cycle, customizability, and wide software
selection. These days, I just use Arch.
Here is a picture of the laptop running Artix Linux
with YouTuber DistroTube's rice of DWM.

## Using Linux as a daily driver
In 2023, when I started my first year of college,
I built a new gaming PC to replace my old build
from 2017. This was a high-end build, and it has
an i5-13600KF, 32GB DDR5 6000 MT/s, and
an RX 7900 XT. When I built this PC, I wanted to
try Linux on it. Since I had an AMD graphics card,
I was going to have a much better experience due to
the better drivers. I was already good with Linux,
so I installed Arch Linux on a second drive. I kept
this setup for a while until I eventually ditched
Windows all together and went full Linux. I continue
to run this setup to this day and I am able to do
any task on Linux, even gaming.

## Conclusion
Overall, I learned a lot from my experience switching
to Linux. While there were definitely times it was
frustrating, I gained a lot of valuable skills, such
as using the command line and troubleshooting skills.
This has been my story of how I got into Linux. I hope
you enjoyed reading through my journey with Linux.
